# Abstract

During a travel the machine tank is quite empty and you need a gas station for refueling.
To discover where to go you use your smartphone and with the EZGas application you have the list of all gas station near and to choose the cheapest or the nearest.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Users| User the application to find the less expensive gas station to refuel the car; also use the application to add a new gas station to the Database  |

# Stories and personas

Brian is a consultant who needs to travel everywhere each day and he uses his car, during his jouneys he has to refuel his car and need to find the gas station nearest his destinations.

John is a social man who likes inform other people as him about their great discovery.

# Functional and non functional requirements

|  FR2    | Produce a list of gas station in a certain area |
|  FR3    | Record station added by a certain user |

## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, .. see iso 9126)           | Description  | Refers to |

## Use case diagram

```plantuml

actor User as u
u -- (FR1 Add a new account for a new user)
u -- (FR2 Add a new gas station and their information)
u -- (FR3 Research all gas station near the user's current position )
```
## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Manage users account with all his personal information

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|  Precondition     | user has no account |
|  Post condition     | user has an account |
| | Information such as username, password, email are requested |
|  Nominal Scenario     | A new user want to use the application and register himself|
|  Variants     | Account already exists, issue warning |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Produce a list of gas station in a certain area

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|  Precondition     | user have an account |
|  Post condition     | user have a list of gas station |
| |  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User wants to know the gas station near is location to choose where to go |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Record station added by a certain user 
| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|  Precondition     | user have an account |
|  Post condition     |  |
| |  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User wants to add to database a gas station that is not known |
|  Variants     |  |

# Relevant scenarios

## Scenario 1

| Scenario ID: SC1        | Corresponds to UC2  |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Description | User use the application to have a list of near gas station|
| Precondition |  user has an account |
| Postcondition |   |
| Step#        |  Step description   |
|  1     | User logs in |
|  2     | User indicates his position |
|  3     | Application retrives a list of gas stations |

## Scenario 2

| Scenario ID: SC2        | Corresponds to UC3  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| Description | User use the application to add a new gas station|
| Precondition |  User has an account|
| Postcondition |  Database has new information |
| Step#        |  Step description   |
|  1     | User logs in |

# Glossary

```plantuml
class EZGas
class Account {
+ username
+password
+ email
}

class GasStation {
+ name
+ price
+ location
}

class AddGasStation

EZGas -- "*" Account
EZGas --"*" GasStation

Acccount -- User
EZGas --"*"AddStation

```

# System Design
Not really meaningful in this case. Only one smartphone is needed.

```plantuml
class "Smartphone"
```

# Deployment Diagram
As a centralized application only one node is needed where all user can connect to.

```plantuml
artifact "EZGasApplication" as a
node "Smartphones" as s
a -- *s
```
